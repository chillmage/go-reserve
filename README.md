# go-reserve

*In which I* **Go**(lang) *and make a reservation backend for a hypothetical side hustle renting out sim kits to aspiring racers/pilots. Cost shouldn't be a barrier for those wanting to prove their mettle behind the wheel or yoke.* 

## Coding ingredients

### Golang

This is my first project beyond Codecademy starters to try and get my head around writing in Go. Will be basing much of the work covered in this project on a [FreeCodeCamp tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-i-set-up-a-real-world-project-with-go-and-vue/)

### Vue.js

My .js UI framework/library of choice. Not really opionated in this case, but a case of reducing complexity due to familiarity with the tool.  Should really be investing time in getting up to speed on React.js again, but don't want to overburden this motivation by attempting to do too many things at once. 

## Project objectives: 
- [ ] Orient myself around Go to serve as back-end for Vue front-end.
- [ ] Understand some of the differences between working in Node.js versus Golang.
- [ ] Perform low-stakes UI design work to get gears going for design portfolio.
- [ ] Be able to say I built something useful for myself in a new language over a single weekend. Just to flex on the h8rs.[^1]

## Check-ins:
**20 December 2021**
Thinking about a [Notion](https://notion.so) integration for the backend. They've got a Javascript SDK, but switching to that now would be a defeat of the main purpose of the project: to pick up Go. I should go back to the Codecademy page.
